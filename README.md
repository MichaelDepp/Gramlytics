Gramlytics is a Web Based Instagram Analytics Application, which can be used to track any public profile's information.

The backend of the application was developed using Express Js. For the front-end I used Next Js. The backend basically performs web scrapping of a given username and process the data for the analytics.
Gramlytics provides a detailed information of any public profile you search. It will display information such as, most liked posts, most commented posts, average likes, comments and also bar graphs to give a illustration of the high traffic days and normal engagement of an Instagram account. If it is a private profile, it will display the basic information of that profile.

The entire application is full responsive. You can view the app in any viewport. This is the sample interface for the mobile view.

After development, I deployed the application to Vercel, it is working but unfortunately Instagram is blocking the web scrapper from scraping the data. Anyways, I have provided the GitHub Link of that repository. You can clone and experiment the application.

As I mentioned, this application was deployed to Vercel, but the web scrapping functionality were blocked by Instagram.
